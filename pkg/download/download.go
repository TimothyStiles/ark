	// Typically I'd write these functions to return errors but since I'm using go routines
	// the blocking nature of using channels to report errors would either make the
	// concurrency of go routines moot or make it so the returned errors were not returned until
	// all of the go routines were done which in this case kind of makes reporting errors a bit useless.

	// The solution here is that all of the functions called by the go routines will just log fatal errors.

	// I suppose it may be of some use to report when go routines are finished for the user's sake but that isn't a priority for
	// this pull request.
